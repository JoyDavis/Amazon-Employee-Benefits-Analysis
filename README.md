# Amazon Employee Benefits Analysis
### Project Description
I assume the role of a data analyst at Amazon, focusing on comparing Amazon’s employee benefits with those of other leading companies in the technology industry. The objective of this analysis is to identify areas where Amazon can enhance its benefits package to improve employee retention and satisfaction, ultimately driving increased productivity and revenue growth.

### Through this analysis, I:
- Evaluate Amazon’s current employee benefits compared to those of leading competitors in the technology industry.
- Identify opportunities for Amazon to enhance its benefits package, focusing on areas where competitors outperform Amazon.
- Understand the impact of employee benefits on employee tenure, and how improving benefits could lead to increased retention and productivity.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to guide Amazon in making strategic decisions that strengthen its position as a top employer in the technology industry.

### Demonstrated Skills
